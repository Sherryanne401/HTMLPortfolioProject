		<h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
		<p>I've made my home base in North Vancouver, British Columbia. I am a fashion designer and it's one of my passion. I decided to take coding because I wanted to make my own website for my designs.... And no, simply buying one online wasn't an option for me. I like putting my own touch to everything I make and do. It makes it feel more personalized for me. When I started learning to code, I rediscovered my love for tech.

		When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to Web Design, where I can use my fashion design background, organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
